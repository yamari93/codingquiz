# Purpose

This quiz is timed and will be asking questions on different states and their capitals. When the timer hits zero, the game is over. The questions are multiple choice and when a choice is selected of the four options, a notice will indicate if the answer chosen is correct or not. There is an option to see the highscores of players indicating name and their corresponding score.
